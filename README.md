# Netflix_Dataset_Analysis
**Netflix Dataset Analysis System**

**Introduction:**
This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing the Netflix dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset consists of information regarding movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including details such as title, director, cast, release year, rating, duration, and more.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this system is to provide tools for exploring and analyzing the Netflix dataset. Users can gain insights into trends, preferences, and patterns within the Netflix catalog, aiding in decision-making processes for content creators, marketers, and enthusiasts.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this system is sourced from Kaggle and is available at the following link: [Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)

**Components:**
1. **Analysis Scripts:** This directory contains Python scripts for data analysis tasks, including data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis.

2. **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive notebooks are provided for conducting analysis and showcasing results in a step-by-step manner. These notebooks serve as a guide for users to understand the analysis process and replicate it for their own purposes.

3. **README.md:** This file provides instructions for setting up the environment, accessing the dataset, running the analysis scripts, and interpreting the results.

4. **Requirements.txt:** Lists the Python packages required to run the analysis scripts. Users can install these dependencies using pip.

5. **License:** Specifies the terms under which the code and dataset are shared.

**Setup:**
